Sky-high crime, officer-involved shootings, cover-ups and corruption: the over-extended and under-funded Chicago Police Department is spiraling out of control. Enter billionaire engineer Gideon Reeves. After his best friend is murdered in a botched attempted robbery, and the killer remains at large, Gideon demands justice. Putting up millions of dollars of his own money, he makes an unprecedented deal to take over the troubled 13th District - and reboot it as a private police force: better, faster and smarter than anything seen before. With cutting-edge technology created by Gideon himself, this eccentric yet brilliant outsider challenges the city\u0027s police force to rethink everything about the way they fight crime.

With the help of Gideon\u0027s gifted tech officer, Ada Hamilton, he and Murphy embark on a mission to turn the 13th District - including a skeptical Sgt.

As Muldoon watches the Hells Kitchen streets where he grew up devoured by an escalating war within two factions of the Irish-American Mob, he becomes more determined than ever to fight back against the city\u0027s dark underbelly so he can provide a safe place where he and his wife, Christine (Masucci), can raise their family. \u003c/p\u003e","releaseDate":"2015-08-25","network":"TNT","title":"Public Morals","numSeason":1,"avgNumOfEp":10.0,"imdbRating":6.9,"imdbVotes":2375},{"genre":["Drama","Crime","Thriller"],"people":[{"type":"Creator","name":"Harry Williams","character":"","followers":1150,"positive_review":0,"negative_review":0},{"type":"Creator","name":"Jack Williams","character":"","followers":2872,"positive_review":0,"negative_review":0},{"type":"Actor","name":"Tchéky Karyo","character":"Julien Baptiste","followers":10769,"positive_review":390,"negative_review":326},{"type":"Actor","name":"Keeley Hawes","character":"Gemma Webster","followers":47749,"positive_review":172,"negative_review":0},{"type":"Actor","name":"Eric Godon","character":"Georges Deloix","followers":148,"positive_review":193,"negative_review":0},{"type":"Actor","name":"David Morrissey","character":"Sam Webster","followers":365115,"positive_review":1087,"negative_review":86},{"type":"Actor","name":"Abigail Hardingham","character":"Alice Webster","followers":6650,"positive_review":73,"negative_review":6}],"duration":60,"rating":8.7,"synopsis":"\u003cp\u003eThriller series exploring the emotional fallout of a child\u0027s abduction not only on the family but on the wider community.\u003c/p\u003e","releaseDate":"2014-10-28","network":"BBC One","title":"The Missing","numSeason":2,"avgNumOfEp":8.0,"imdbRating":6.5,"imdbVotes":28678},{"genre":["Drama","Crime","Legal"],"people":[{"type":"Creator","name":"Liz Friedlander","character":"","followers":17,"positive_review":0,"negative_review":0},{"type":"Executive Producer","name":"Liz Friedlander","character":"","followers":17,"positive_review":120,"negative_review":4},{"type":"Executive Producer","name":"Thomas L.
